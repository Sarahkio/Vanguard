          My favorite Movies and Shows are made using 4 different genres:
          <em> Horror, Thriller, Comedy, and Action</em>
        </p>

        <p>
        In this post, let‚Äôs focus on Movies/Shows. A short summary of each and why you should watch them.
        </p>

        <h3>What are Movies/Shows?</h3>
        <p>
          Movies talk about different things and are creative.
          <strong>Movies have a clear beginning, middle and end.</strong>
          A movie may run about two to three hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          TV show/series are those that are based on concepts that sell at the moment.
        <strong>TV shows are episodic and allow for multiple beginnings, middles and ends.</strong>
          Each TV script is part of a larger narrative, with multiple character and story arcs divided across a number of episodes and seasons.
          TV series does not have any time schedule.

        </p>
        <p>In Vanguard, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

        <ol>
          <li class="first-li">Blog</li>
          <li>Genres</li>
          <li>Actors/Actress</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why should you watch these Genres?</h3>

        <p>
          If you enjoy watching scary, funny and rescues and frantic chases.
          Here are 5 reasons to watch them:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li class="first-li">
            The protagonist gets involved with life threatening situtations while fighting a dangeroud villian
          </li>
          <li>
          it gives you the opportunity to feel fear and naviate through that emotion in a controlled envrironment
          </li>
          <li>give viewers heightened feelings of suspense, excitement, surprise, anticipation, and anxiety</li>
          <li>Betrayal and who to trust</li>
          <li>entertainment, good laughs and to have fun üòÉ</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important: </strong>Always consider the people's ratings on <em>Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB</em>
          when deciding which show or movie to watch</p>
