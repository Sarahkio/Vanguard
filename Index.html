      <p>
        Introduction to my website that i will be talking about in
        <em>Vanguard</em>
        Website: Blog, Family, Shopping, and Contact. This is what I came up with so far.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on Blog. We will learn what Blog is all
        about, and why am i talking about it.
      </p>

      <h3>What is Blog?</h3>
      <p>
        Blog stands for <strong>B</strong>eautiful<strong>L</strong>ong
        <strong>O</strong>riginal <strong>G</strong>ibberish. It's about
        something I will talk about when I have something to talk about. Right
        now just writing whatever comes to my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The blog will consists of elements that describe different types of content:
        Shopping list or items, family memebers or made up family from celebrities or actors,
        contact list that will go nowhere or I might change that to something else.
      </p>
      <p>In Vanguard, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

      <ol>
        <li class="first-li">Blog</li>
        <li>Shopping</li>
        <li>Family</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        You can learn more at
        <a href="https://videotimewasters.com" target="_blank">My Website</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Why should you Read Vanguard?</h3>

      <p>
        It could be to pass the time but I can't force you. Here are 5 of them:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li class="first-li">
          To be able to see HTML and CSS being used
        </li>
        <li>
          To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
          Worpress or Wix
        </li>
        <li>To build web applications</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun üòÉ</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
